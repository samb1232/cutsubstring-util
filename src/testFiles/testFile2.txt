ody once told me the world is gonna roll me
't the sharpest tool in the shed
as looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
e shape of an "L" on her forehead
the years start coming and they don't stop coming
o the rules and I hit the ground running
t make sense not to live for fun
brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
ch to do, so much to see
at's wrong with taking the back streets?
l never know if you don't go
l never shine if you don't glow
