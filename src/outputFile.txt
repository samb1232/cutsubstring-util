Somebody once told me the world
I ain't the sharpest tool in
She was looking kind of dumb
In the shape of an "L"
Well the years start coming and
Fed to the rules and I
Didn't make sense not to live
Your brain gets smart but your
So much to do, so much
So what's wrong with taking the
You'll never know if you don't
You'll never shine if you don't
